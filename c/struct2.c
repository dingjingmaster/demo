/**
 * Bit Fields
 *
 * Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members:
 * Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
 *
 * use example:
 *  1. Packing several objects into a machine word.
 *       e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
 *  2. Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats
 *       could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
 *
 * construction:
 *  C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible,
 *  provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to
 *  the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case,
 *  then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while
 *  others would store the next field in the next word.
